warning: Git tree '/home/cameron/.nixos' is dirty
evaluation warning: cameron profile: You are using

                      Home Manager version 25.05 and
                      Nixpkgs version 24.11.

                    Using mismatched versions is likely to cause errors and unexpected
                    behavior. It is therefore highly recommended to use a release of Home
                    Manager that corresponds with your chosen release of Nixpkgs.

                    If you insist then you can disable this warning by adding

                      home.enableNixpkgsReleaseCheck = false;

                    to your configuration.
